## Portfolio

This is the project for my Portfolio, which shows things I've made. It's [currently available for viewing on GitHub Pages](https://ceg9498.github.io/portfolio/).

I originally made this as one of the projects for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s Responsive Web Design certification, but I liked it so much I decided to keep it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
